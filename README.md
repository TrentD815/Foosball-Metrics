# Foosball Metrics

## Overview
Foosball Metrics is a simple interface to log foosball matches and track stats

## Features
- Log foosball matches including score, date, players, and team names (In progress)
- View history of all previously logged matches with search capability (In progress)
- View a collection of leaderboards with various fun stats and milestones (In progress)
- View and customize a ruleset tailored to your foosball table (In progress)

## Personal Goals For This Project
- Create an interface that makes it easy to log in foosball matches and also be a fun place to look 
  at the lifetime stats of the table
- Complete another project using a modern web framework/language. I chose Angular/Typescript again because there
  were still features that I wanted to try out that I didn't get to explore in my previous project
- Get some initial exposure with NoSQL databases. All of my previous experience has been using
  relational databases so far
